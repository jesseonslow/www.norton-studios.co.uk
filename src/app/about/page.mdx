# About

The process of getting a website made is broken. It's expensive, it takes too long, and too often the end result is designed around the developers' needs - not the clients. SizeByte wants to change that.

We code our sites from scratch. That means no WordPress, no bloat, and no nasty surprises. Just fast, responsive websites that meet your needs. And the best part is we don't charge anything upfront.
