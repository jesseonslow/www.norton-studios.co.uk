# C2C Trenitalia

C2C Trenitalia is a train operator in the UK. They are a subsidiary of Trenitalia, the primary train operator in Italy. C2C Trenitalia operates the London, Tilbury, and Southend Railway franchise. They run trains from London Fenchurch Street to destinations in Essex, including Southend-on-Sea.

## Case study

After acquiring the C2C franchise, Trenitalia wanted to re-launch their UK Rail ticketing using their existing Italian ticketing platform. Norton Studios helped them to navigate the complexities of the UK rail industry and adapt their existing platform with the UK's ticketing systems.
